        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Dominic Baez. I am 18 years old and I attend UCR and am majoring in business. I graduated from Eleanor Roosevelt High school where I maintained honor roll or honors with distinction throughout all four years. I played soccer all four years and was chosen captain of the team. I have played soccer since I was around three years old. I value bettering myself and learning from experience works the best for me. Experience makes people who they are. I have no current professional experience as of today, but I do have a lot of a lot of volunteer work. I have volunteered at homeless shelters and packing bags for children in need. I have leadership experience from soccer and school.<br><br>

        For the homeless shelter and packing bags for children in need I needed to show leadership skills and management skills. I needed to help organize groups, get the proper materials in order, and make sure everyone stayed on task. I had to do all of this while doing my work too. I was able to do everything I had to while making sure everything got done through communicating with my teammates. We were able to make sure everything was getting done and all the food was being prepared. For the packing bags for children we have to stay on task in a short amount of time. Packing hundreds of bags in such a short amount of time is a tough task, but we were able to do it. I was able to get experience of management (administration) through teamwork and hardworking as a group.<br><br>

        Experience can come from many things though, as simple as school and sports. School teaches us time management, communication skills, and so much more which can all be applied to business administration. I have been able to obtain all these skills and look to keep improving them as much as possible. I have been able to improve many skills through school, due to all the opportunities it provides. Soccer has also played a huge part in my experience. I have grown up through soccer. It has allowed me to find who I truly am and be able to grow as a person. It allowed me to learn from my mistakes and grow. Communication is a key part of soccer. Leadership is a key part of soccer. Both are also involved in business administration. I used to not be good at communicating, I never wanted to speak out even though I had the right idea sometimes. My coaches saw this and told me that I would never get my views across and my mindset acknowledged if I never spoke up. They saw that I had the right ideas, but I just would not say anything. I realized that I have to communicate, and I have to lead in order to get the results we want. This was not only just about winning in soccer; it was about growing as a person in general.
